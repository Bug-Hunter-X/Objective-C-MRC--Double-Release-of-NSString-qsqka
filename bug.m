In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the `retain` and `release` methods (or their counterparts in ARC).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

// ...in some other method...
MyClass *myObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
myObject.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString: @"Hello"];
[myObject release];
```

The issue lies in the double-release of `myString`. `myString` is retained when assigned. When `myObject` is released in `[myObject release];`, its `dealloc` method gets called, which in turn releases `myString`. This is fine. However, since `myString` was allocated separately using `[[NSString alloc] initWithString: ...]`, it also needs to be released explicitly before it's assigned to the `myString` property of `myObject`.  Therefore, the correct code would be:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

// ...in some other method...
MyClass *myObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
NSString *tempString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString: @"Hello"];
myObject.myString = tempString;
[tempString release]; // Release tempString to avoid double release
[myObject release];
```

This double-release can lead to crashes, particularly if using manual reference counting (MRC) where the second release leads to a double free error.
